Experience (Learn Square ) Role -> Software Developer Intern(may-5-2025 - cur) https://speak-ship.vercel.app/: 

first i got selected for the learnsquare but its bad I didn't receive any stiphend 
intrestingly I got another 10k internship but I can't joined because I don't of Idon't have a good laptop to support their code base

okay coming to this internship I have selected for college with coding rounds and assignments and quizzes and I have placed first in each and every round and always be in the top position
after I got for internship and in full stack developer intern role assigned me a project of quick delivery app lite application and given formed a team of three members and I am the leading role of the project

what we did in the project is 
1) created a repository and initialsed and have created entire project and fronted backend integration so that we came up with the top level view of our project and 
in the first week we have implemented the authentication functionalities
next a customer can create delivery and driver can see all the list of deliveries and accept it
after accepting the driver and customer can able to track their own orders/deliveries
after that we have made a advanced search functionalities to search with status like pending , accepted , in-transist , assigned , delivered cancelled and after delivery one user can give one review and driver can able t to see it and a profile page and personalised dashboards with the roles like customer , driver , admin

whats I think great in it
1) feature -based folder structure scalable maintainable folder structure with dry and solid principles
2) google auth , OTP base verification 
3) cliudinary , gemini API for price prediction , integrated maps forbetter experience
4) followed spring and agile mode with standups , meets, reviews , presentations , github collaborations etc
5) advanced search functionalities , pagination , lazy loading
6) socket.io chat features
7)coins and coupons for gamify experience
8)trying to integrate voice but not yet completed
9)mailing functionality and top verification after delivery and also always sending respective mails to the users for realtime notifications and updates
tech stack : mern , gemini API , tailwind , leaflet ,socket io also include recharts but still I didn't implemented it

7)i have did the book-review system which is really very very good working really its very very high level but the problem is it don't have much more features it is jsut seeing and searching books and see them and give rating but the code base is the solid one it is really more than a high production level i have did it with mern stack but all good practices like folder structure , etc

8) projct is like the chat gpt clone with image and text generation context aware ai and total project is built with ai agents and used tech stacks like next.js , superbase , auth 0 all unknown skills it is showing the best ai utilisation like bolt and copilot
